## Localization

Help [translate Ruddarr](https://crowdin.com/project/ruddarr) into any language. Check the `#translators` channel [on Discord](https://discord.gg/UksvtDQUBA). Unfortunately, [some messages](https://github.com/ruddarr/app/issues/433) cannot be translated by Ruddarr.

## Notifications

The code of the notification service is powered by a Cloudflare Worker and also [open source](https://github.com/ruddarr/apns-worker).

## URL Schemes

Ruddarr supports the `ruddarr://` URL Scheme to open specific tabs, items or perform actions. All supported schemes are listed in the [`QuickActions.swift`](https://github.com/ruddarr/app/blob/develop/Ruddarr/Dependencies/QuickActions.swift)

## Development

To build the app locally Xcode must be signed into an Apple Account:

```
Xcode → Settings → Accounts
```

Next, select the Apple Account's team for the `Ruddarr` and `NotificationService` targets:

```
Ruddarr → Signing & Capabilities → Targets → {target} -> Signing -> Team
```

Now choose between **a)** creating a provisioning profile on your account for the `iCloud` and `Push Notification` capabilities and skipping the next steps, or **b)** continuing on and removing the capabilities from:

```
Ruddarr → Signing & Capabilities → Targets → Ruddarr
```

Then uncomment the CloudKit mock in `Ruddarr::init()`:

```swift
dependencies.cloudkit = .mock
```

Lastly, change `@CloudStorage` to `@AppStorage` in `AppSettings`:

```diff
- @CloudStorage("instances") var instances: [Instance] = []
+ @AppStorage("instances") var instances: [Instance] = []
```

That's it. Select a run destination and build it. 

### Sentry Symbols

Create a `.sentryclirc` file:

```yml

### Reset Xcode

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app
xcrun simctl --set previews delete all
```
